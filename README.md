COMP 20 Fall 2015 Private Repo for Joshua Kaltman

1. The purpose of this Git repository is to store all assignments and labs from Comp20 in one place that is easily accessible. 
2. My favorite lab was the Duckhunt lab. I never knew about sprite sheets and how it is so much faster to load one sheet and simply show different parts of it at a time. I also found the placing of images on a canvas very cool and the idea of doing animations with different images was interesting.
3. I have grown a tremendous amount from day 1 of this course to now. I came in not even know what HTML was and now I know about so many different types of languages, programs and resources available.
4. The most important thing I learned in this course was that most of your questions can be found by doing a simple google search. For example, on assignment 3, I did not know how to code the Haversine formula, but a simple google search gave me the exact code. In addition, while working on assignment 4, I did not know to sort by timestamp but I found a simple function to do it after searching on google. I learned that you don't have to re-invent the wheel and hard code a lot of functions-most of them are available for you to use.
5. I would love to delve deeper into the topic of security. I would like to learn more about attacking vulnerable websites and learning how to defend your website from attackers by experienced hackers.
