Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side (Assignments 2 and 3)

1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. A security assessment on a potentially vulnerable web application was performed and the findings were written up in a report. Note: Gabe Joseph's report from Spring 2013 was used as a template.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. My partner sent me his source code for assignment 4.
3. I spent about four hours on this assignment, including the reading.
